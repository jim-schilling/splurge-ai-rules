# splurge-cursor-rules 
A comprehensive collection of Cursor AI rules for consistent, high-quality code development across multiple domains.

## Overview

This repository contains a set of Cursor AI rules that enforce best practices for software development, with a focus on Python development. The rules are organized into 11 main categories covering various aspects of code quality, design, security, and development processes.

## Rule Categories

### üèóÔ∏è Design Standards
- Follow SOLID, DRY, BDD (TDD), MVP, KISS, PoLA, and YAGNI design principles
- Prefer composition over inheritance and encapsulation
- Emphasize separation of concerns and fail fast approach
- Follow law of demeter and guard clauses for preconditions
- Prioritize error handling with try blocks and guard clauses
- Use domain-specific custom exceptions for public APIs
- Prefer native/built-in exceptions for low-level APIs
- Avoid side effects in module-level code and place happy path logic last
- Prefer if blocks over if-else chains and iteration over code duplication
- Follow simple, straightforward design principles

### üé® Style Standards
- Prefer line length max of 120 characters, except when to do so would require temporary variables
- Except clauses shall be prefixed with a blank line
- Prefer separating logical blocks of code with a blank line for visual clarity
- For Python, use parentheses only for line continuations
- For Python, use ruff for code style, linting, and formatting
- Avoid magic strings and magic numbers, prefer class-level constants, otherwise use module/function level constants

### üîÑ SDLC Standards
- Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement development lifecycle
- Document research in `docs/research-[yyyy-MM-ddTHHmm]-[sequence].md`
- Document action plans in `docs/plan-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md`
- TDD implementation: failing tests ‚Üí code ‚Üí refactor cycle
- Plans include requirements, testing strategy (e.g. TDD and BDD), and step-by-step guides
- Every feature MUST begin as a standalone library before application integration
- Every software library must expose functionality through a CLI
- If in doubt, prompt user for clarification and mark as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### üìö Documentation Standards
- Comments for complex logic blocks only
- Avoid inline comments except for complex intent clarification
- Google-style docstrings for Python
- Minimize noisy comments for refactors/redesigns

### üîß Method Standards
- Parameters on separate lines for readability
- Named keyword arguments for defaults
- Keywords required for methods with multiple parameters
- Multi-line formatting for methods with >2 parameters
- No backwards compatibility maintenance unless specified

### üè∑Ô∏è Naming Standards
- Descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `is_active`, `has_permission`)
- PascalCase for acronyms/abbreviations in object definitions
- Lowercase column names for SQL
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### üêç Python Standards
- Always type-annotate method signatures
- Type annotations where clarity is needed
- Use `|` instead of `Optional` or `Union`
- Adhere to PEP 8 and PEP 585 standards
- Target Python 3.10+ features
- Absolute import paths preferred
- Imports at module top when possible
- Sort imports grouped by standard libraries ‚Üí third-party libraries ‚Üí local libraries (alphabetically within each group)

### üß™ Testing Standards
- Validate public API behavior only
- Use actual data, interfaces, and objects (avoid mocks)
- Target 85% code coverage for public interfaces
- Prefer shared test helpers for common logic
- Validate text patterns, not exact content/formatting
- pytest ecosystem: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-xdist
- Default pytest parameters: `-x -v -n auto`

### üìÅ Project Standards
- Create top-level folder: `docs/`
- Create `docs/README-details.md` which details project features, usage, etc.
- For code projects: create top-level folders: `tests/`, `examples/`, `specs/`
- Under `tests/`: create `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/` sub-folders
- For Python projects: use modern `pyproject.toml` configuration
- For Python projects: implement CalVer versioning
- Create project `README.md` which summarizes project
- Create project `CHANGELOG.md` which details changes for each version/feature-branch
- Standard license: MIT
- Standard author/maintainer: Jim Schilling
- Standard base URL: `http://github.com/jim-schilling/[REPOSITORY]`

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Standards
- Command-line interfaces MUST accept text as input (via stdin, arguments, or files)
- Command-line interfaces MUST produce text as output (via stdout)
- Command-line interfaces MUST support JSON format for structured data exchange

### üîí Security Standards
- Follow secure coding best practices and OWASP guidelines
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, Shell, XSS, command injection)
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Never store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens) in plain text
- Follow the principle of least privilege for user permissions and API access
- Implement comprehensive error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Restrict allowed file types and sizes for uploads
- Use secure random number generators for cryptographic operations
- Implement proper logging without logging sensitive information
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for configuration secrets
- Implement proper password policies and secure password hashing
- Follow secure API design principles (proper HTTP methods, versioning, etc.)

## Usage

These rules are designed to be used with Cursor AI to maintain consistent code quality and development practices. Each rule file (`.mdc` format) can be individually enabled/disabled based on project needs.

## Installation

Clone this repository and configure Cursor AI to use the rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
