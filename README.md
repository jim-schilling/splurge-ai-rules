A comprehensive collection of AI rules for consistent, high-quality code development across multiple domains.

## Overview

This repository contains a set of AI rules / instructions for Cursor and GitHub Copilot that enforce best practices for software development, with a focus on Python development. The rules are organized into 11 main categories covering various aspects of code quality, design, security, and development processes. All rules have been recently reviewed and updated for maximum clarity and actionable guidance.

## Rule Categories

### üèóÔ∏è Design Standards
- Follow SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) principles
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Follow BDD/TDD (Behavior/Test Driven Development) practices
- Follow MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach
- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle
- Follow PoLA (Principle of Least Authority)
- Follow YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Prefer encapsulation
- Prefer separation of concerns
- Prefer to fail fast
- Follow the Law of Demeter - objects should only interact with their immediate dependencies
- Prioritize error handling using appropriate mechanisms (exceptions, return values, Result types, or callbacks)
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid state early
- Avoid side effects in module-level code
- Place the happy path (main successful execution flow) last in the function
- Use guard clauses and early returns instead of complex if-else chains
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Prefer simple, straightforward design over over-engineering
- Private methods should accept necessary data as parameters rather than directly accessing instance variables
- Use domain-specific custom exceptions for public APIs
- Use native/built-in exceptions for low-level APIs, where appropriate
- Prioritize code clarity while maintaining reasonable efficiency

### üé® Style Standards
- Prefer line length max of 120 characters, except when to do so would require temporary variables
- Except clauses shall be prefixed with a blank line
- Prefer separating logical blocks of code with a blank line for visual clarity
- For Python, use parentheses only for line continuations
- For Python, use ruff for code style, linting, and formatting
- Avoid magic strings and magic numbers, prefer class-level constants, otherwise use module/function level constants

### üîÑ SDLC Standards
- Follow Research, Plan, and Implement development lifecycle
- Document research in `docs/research-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md`
- Document action plans in `docs/plan-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md`
- Document requirements and specifications in `specs/spec-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md`
- TDD implementation: write failing tests ‚Üí implement code ‚Üí run tests ‚Üí refactor iteratively
- Plans include requirements, acceptance criteria, testing strategy (TDD/BDD), and step-by-step guides
- Every feature must start as a standalone library before integration:
  - Develop features as independent, reusable library components first
  - Only integrate into larger applications after proving standalone functionality
- Software tools, primary libraries, and development tools must expose functionality through a CLI
- If in doubt, prompt user for clarification and mark as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### üìö Documentation Standards
- Add comments before complex logic blocks to explain the "why" and "what"
- Use inline comments sparingly, only for complex or non-obvious code sections
- Remove outdated comments during refactoring instead of accumulating them
- Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules in Python

### üîß Method Standards
- Prefer parameters in method signatures and calls to be listed on separate lines
- Prefer named keyword arguments for default parameters
- Require keywords for methods with more than 1 parameter
- Format method signatures with >2 parameters with each parameter on a separate line
- Format method calls with >2 parameters with each parameter on a separate line
- Include practical code examples for multi-parameter formatting
- Do not maintain backwards compatibility unless specifically requested

### üè∑Ô∏è Naming Standards
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `is_active`, `has_permission`)
- Use PascalCase for class, enum, and dataclass names (e.g., `DsvReader`, `CsvWriter`, `TransformXmlToJson`)
- Prefer lowercase column names for SQL
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constant names
- Environment variables must use project prefix `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*_` (e.g., `SPLURGE_DSV_`)

### üêç Python Standards
- Always add type annotations to function and method signatures
- Add type annotations to variables when it improves code clarity
- Prefer `|` instead of `Optional` or `Union` (Python 3.10+ union syntax)
- Write concise, technical Python that adheres to PEP 8 and PEP 585
- Target modern Python standards (version 3.10 or later)
- Use absolute import paths
- Place imports at module top when possible
- Group and sort imports: standard libraries, then third-party libraries, then local libraries (alphabetically within each group)
- Use separate statements for multiple context managers instead of nesting them

### üß™ Testing Standards
- Validate behavior of public APIs only
- Prefer validation using actual data, interfaces, and objects
- Avoid use of mocks, except where appropriate
- Target 85% code coverage for all public interfaces and methods
- Prefer shared helpers for common logic
- Avoid validation of implementation details and private APIs
- Prefer validation of patterns of text, avoid exact matching of content and formatting
- pytest ecosystem: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-xdist
- Default pytest parameters: `-x -v -n auto`
- Test organization: unit/ in `tests/unit/`, integration/ in `tests/integration/`, e2e/ in `tests/e2e/`, performance/ in `tests/performance/`
- Prefer pure pytest function style tests
- Use `tmp_path` and `tmp_path_factory` fixtures for temporary files and directories
- Name test methods as `test_[condition]_[expectedResult]`
- Each test method should ideally test a single condition and expected result
- Use fixtures for common setup and teardown logic
- Use parameterized tests for testing multiple input scenarios
- Use assertions to validate expected outcomes
- Performance guidelines: unit tests (<60s), integration tests (<60s), e2e tests (<60s), full suite (<120s)

### üìÅ Project Standards
- Create top-level folder: `docs/`
- Create `docs/README-details.md` which details project features, usage, etc.
- For code projects: create top-level folders: `tests/`, `examples/`, `specs/`
- Under `tests/`: create `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/` sub-folders
- For Python projects: use modern `pyproject.toml` configuration
- For Python projects: implement CalVer versioning
- Create project `README.md` which summarizes project
- Create project `CHANGELOG.md` which details changes for each version/feature-branch
- Standard license: MIT
- Standard author/maintainer: Jim Schilling
- Standard base URL: `http://github.com/jim-schilling/[REPOSITORY]`

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Standards
- MUST accept text input via stdin, arguments, or files
- MUST accept environment variables for configuration, unless user opts out
- Sensitive data must use environment variables
- Environment variable names MUST use project prefix `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*_` (e.g., `SPLURGE_DSV_`)
- Provide `--output-format {table,json,ndjson}` options (default: table)
- When reading from stdin, a file path of `-` MUST mean "read from stdin"
- Stdout and stderr MUST be UTF-8 encoded without BOM
- Standard exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (error), 2 (invalid arguments), 130 (interrupted)
- Flags map by prefix + uppercasing + hyphens‚Üíunderscores (e.g., `--api-token` ‚Üí `SPLURGE_DSV_API_TOKEN`)
- JSON output formats:
  - `--output-format json`: Output complete JSON arrays, one per line
  - `--output-format ndjson`: Output one JSON object per line (newline-delimited)
  - Never mix JSON with other text on stdout
- If an env var is referenced but missing, fail fast: "Missing required environment variable: <NAME>"
- Redact sensitive data in output, logging, and errors
- Document defaults in --help output
- CLI arguments override environment variables
- Environment variables override built-in defaults

### üîí Security Standards
- Follow secure coding best practices and OWASP guidelines
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, Shell, XSS, command injection)
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Never store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens) in plain text
- Follow the principle of least privilege for user permissions and API access
- Implement comprehensive error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Restrict allowed file types and sizes for uploads
- Use secure random number generators for cryptographic operations
- Implement proper logging without logging sensitive information
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for configuration secrets
- Implement proper password policies and secure password hashing
- Follow secure API design principles (proper HTTP methods, versioning, etc.)
