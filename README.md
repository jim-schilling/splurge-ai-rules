# splurge-ai-rules 
A comprehensive collection of AI rules for consistent, high-quality code development across multiple domains.

## Overview

This repository contains a set of AI rules / instructions for Cursor and GitHub Copilot that enforce best practices for software development, with a focus on Python development. The rules are organized into 11 main categories covering various aspects of code quality, design, security, and development processes. All rules have been recently reviewed and updated for maximum clarity and actionable guidance.

## Rule Categories

### üèóÔ∏è Design Standards
- Follow SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) principles
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles
- Practice BDD/TDD (Behavior/Test Driven Development) and MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approaches
- Follow PoLA (Principle of Least Authority) for secure design
- Prefer composition over inheritance and strong encapsulation
- Emphasize separation of concerns and fail-fast error handling
- Follow Law of Demeter - objects should only interact with immediate dependencies
- Use guard clauses for preconditions and early returns instead of complex if-else chains
- Place happy path (main successful execution flow) last in functions
- Use domain-specific custom exceptions for public APIs, native exceptions for low-level APIs
- Avoid side effects in module-level code and prefer simple, straightforward designs

### üé® Style Standards
- Prefer line length max of 120 characters, except when to do so would require temporary variables
- Except clauses shall be prefixed with a blank line
- Prefer separating logical blocks of code with a blank line for visual clarity
- For Python, use parentheses only for line continuations
- For Python, use ruff for code style, linting, and formatting
- Avoid magic strings and magic numbers, prefer class-level constants, otherwise use module/function level constants

### üîÑ SDLC Standards
- Follow Research, Plan, and Implement development lifecycle
- Document research in `docs/research-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md`
- Document action plans in `docs/plan-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md`
- Document requirements and specifications in `specs/spec-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md`
- TDD implementation: write failing tests ‚Üí implement code ‚Üí run tests ‚Üí refactor iteratively
- Plans include requirements, acceptance criteria, testing strategy (TDD/BDD), and step-by-step guides
- Every feature must start as a standalone library before integration:
  - Develop features as independent, reusable library components first
  - Only integrate into larger applications after proving standalone functionality
- Software tools, primary libraries, and development tools must expose functionality through a CLI
- If in doubt, prompt user for clarification and mark as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### üìö Documentation Standards
- Add comments before complex logic blocks to explain the "why" and "what"
- Use inline comments sparingly, only for complex or non-obvious code sections
- Remove outdated comments during refactoring instead of accumulating them
- Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules in Python

### üîß Method Standards
- Prefer parameters in method signatures and calls to be listed on separate lines
- Prefer named keyword arguments for default parameters
- Require keywords for methods with more than 1 parameter
- Format method signatures with >2 parameters with each parameter on a separate line
- Format method calls with >2 parameters with each parameter on a separate line
- Include practical code examples for multi-parameter formatting
- Do not maintain backwards compatibility unless specifically requested

### üè∑Ô∏è Naming Standards
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `is_active`, `has_permission`)
- Use PascalCase for class, enum, and dataclass names (e.g., `DsvReader`, `CsvWriter`, `TransformXmlToJson`)
- Prefer lowercase column names for SQL
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constant names
- Environment variables must use project prefix `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*_` (e.g., `SPLURGE_DSV_`)

### üêç Python Standards
- Always add type annotations to function and method signatures
- Add type annotations to variables when it improves code clarity
- Prefer `|` instead of `Optional` or `Union` (Python 3.10+ union syntax)
- Write concise, technical Python that adheres to PEP 8 and PEP 585
- Target modern Python standards (version 3.10 or later)
- Use absolute import paths
- Place imports at module top when possible
- Group and sort imports: standard libraries, then third-party libraries, then local libraries (alphabetically within each group)
- Use separate statements for multiple context managers instead of nesting them

### üß™ Testing Standards
- Validate public API behavior only
- Use actual data, interfaces, and objects (avoid mocks)
- Target 85% code coverage for public interfaces
- Prefer shared test helpers for common logic
- Validate text patterns, not exact content/formatting
- pytest ecosystem: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-xdist
- Default pytest parameters: `-x -v -n auto`

### üìÅ Project Standards
- Create top-level folder: `docs/`
- Create `docs/README-details.md` which details project features, usage, etc.
- For code projects: create top-level folders: `tests/`, `examples/`, `specs/`
- Under `tests/`: create `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/` sub-folders
- For Python projects: use modern `pyproject.toml` configuration
- For Python projects: implement CalVer versioning
- Create project `README.md` which summarizes project
- Create project `CHANGELOG.md` which details changes for each version/feature-branch
- Standard license: MIT
- Standard author/maintainer: Jim Schilling
- Standard base URL: `http://github.com/jim-schilling/[REPOSITORY]`

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Standards
- Accept text input via stdin, arguments, or files
- Support environment variables for configuration (use project prefix for sensitive data)
- Provide `--output-format {table,json,ndjson}` options (default: table)
- JSON output formats: complete arrays for `json`, one object per line for `ndjson`
- Use UTF-8 encoding without BOM for stdout/stderr
- Standard exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (error), 2 (invalid arguments), 130 (interrupted)
- Environment variable flags map with prefix + uppercasing + hyphens‚Üíunderscores
- Fail fast for missing required environment variables with clear error messages
- Redact sensitive data in output, logging, and error messages
- Document defaults in --help output

### üîí Security Standards
- Follow secure coding best practices and OWASP guidelines
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, Shell, XSS, command injection)
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Never store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens) in plain text
- Follow the principle of least privilege for user permissions and API access
- Implement comprehensive error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Restrict allowed file types and sizes for uploads
- Use secure random number generators for cryptographic operations
- Implement proper logging without logging sensitive information
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for configuration secrets
- Implement proper password policies and secure password hashing
- Follow secure API design principles (proper HTTP methods, versioning, etc.)

## Usage

These rules are designed to be used with Cursor AI to maintain consistent code quality and development practices. Each rule file (`.mdc` format) can be individually enabled/disabled based on project needs.

## Installation

Clone this repository and configure Cursor AI to use the rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
